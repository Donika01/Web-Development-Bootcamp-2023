/* BOOTSTRAP - The world's most popular CSS framework */

/* Bootstrap consists a collection of components, different pieces that we can use and insert into our app and the Grid System (laying out our website) */

/* class container is a responsive, fixed-width container, meaning its max-width changes at each breakpoint */
/* .container-fluid - The content goes on the whole page */
/* Fore the Grid System we need to work within a container */

/* Class="lead" */
/* Class="display-1" */
/* Class="blockquote" */
/* Class="blockquote-footer" */
/* Class="text-center" */
/* Class="mb-0" - margin bottom = 0*/

/* Utilities do not stend alone, they are not necessarily components. We add them onto something */
